# Economy DiscordBot

An economy discord bot that uses mongodb to store user's progress. It also has cool cooldown system that is able to set cooldowns for commands and subcommands.

This is far from done and currently not under development. Might come back to it though. 

## Commands and Their Usage:
* /balance - Shows the users money in wallet and bank
* /deposit - Deposits money from wallet to bank (e.g. /deposit 50% or /deposit [tenth/max] or /deposit 15k etc)
* /withdraw - Withdraws money from bank to wallet (similar as deposit)
* /inventory - Shows the users inventory of items using buttons to switch between pages
* /settings - Modify user settings (e.g. you can turn on compact mode for the /inventory to fit more items on a single page)


## Future Plans:
* /pet - Buy/Take Care/Train pets
