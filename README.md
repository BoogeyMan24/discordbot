# discordbot

An economy discord bot that uses mongodb to store users progress.
This is far from done and not updated currently. 

Commands and their usage:
/balance - Shows the users money in wallet and bank
/deposit - Deposits money from wallet to bank (e.g. /deposit 50% or /deposit [tenth/max] or /deposit 15k etc)
/withdraw - Withdraws money from bank to wallet (similar as deposit)
/inventory - Shows the users inventory of items using buttons to switch between pages
/settings - Modify user settings (e.g. you can turn on compact mode for the /inventory to fit more items on a single page)
